The book is pretty alright i guess. I shall learn some good java core basics from it. I hope to finish it soon. 2-3 chapters in 2 days. I lack alot of basic java learning which i aim to fix.

The first chapter is pretty much a filler chapter so i might just skim through it.


what really is an api? An application programming interface.

To me, an api is an endpoint which abstracts away a service. I still think it's a smaller definition. I will try to see a better definition.

A better definition is a way to define an api is to say that it is a connection between computers or computer programs.
It is a type of software interface, offering services to other pieces of software. 

The first chapter just described java, how it was made, what were the goals and how it is better than cpp.

I need to learn a few things like just in time compilation, how java code is interpreted, and what were the 12 hot buzzwords or whatever in java whitepaper.
