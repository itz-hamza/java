Java is case sensitive!
you always need to remember this fact.

The main method always has to be 'main' not 'Main'
Everything inside a java program must be inside a class
I also need to have a look over access modifiers
The standard naming convention: 
-class names are nouns which start with an uppercase
-we use CamelCase
-the name of the file should be same as the public class
-Each java file can only have one public class

The main method, for extremely obvious reasons, should be public

In java all methods, even main method resides in a class. 
Everything in java has to be in a class!

There is a third type of comment in java which goes like this /** */ 
Apparently this is used to generate documentation.

In java, there are basically 8 primitive types.

4 of them are integer types such as int, long, short, byte.

In java the range of int, or any datatype is not dependant on the implementation or machine java is running on.

int -> 4 bytes
short -> 2 bytes
long -> 8 bytes
byte -> 1 byte

short and byte are usually used at low level.

The range of all these types are generally fixed.

Hex has prefix 0X, long have a suffix (l/L) and octals have suffix 0.

We can also write numbers in binary with a prefix 0b or 0B.

Moreover, we can have underscores in between the numbers as well. such as 100_000_000.


Then there's float and double. float is 4 bytes and have 6-7 decimal digits. While double has 15 significant decimal digits. ALways a better idea to use double.

All floats should have a suffix f or F. any decimal number without this suffix is considered to be a long
