I was trying to solve a leetcode problem, 217(check duplicates) 
In that, I was figuring out which data structure shall I be using, and in java, I saw that using a HashSet is an optimal thing.

A hashset stores unique elements in an unordered manner.

It has o(1) to search, insert, and removing.

I have yet to figure out how it works, but apparently it uses some sort of hashing to index the data.
