Here I am going to write about the core theoretical java concepts I am unfamiliar with. Something like JIT and JVM. What really is byte code? How it is interpreted. What really is interpretation of code and how different it is from compilation. I intend to spend a good amount of time learning this. THen I will head to second chapter.

So another thing worth nothing is that java is first compiled to bytecode. This is a compilation process. But the jvm interprets the language. JIT makes this process faster. Now I need to understand a bit what interpretation really means in java.

this above is a helpful url to read the java compilation process. just putting it here
