Functional Interfaces

    Functional Interfaces are interfaces with a single abstract function, a function without a body, and only with
    a method signature and parameter/s. It is, as I understood, can be implemented by a lambda function.

    Let's say we have a functional interface called Add. In this interface, let us say that we have an abstract
    method called plus, which returns an integer and takes two integer arguments.

    what we can do in our code is that we can have something like this : 
        
        Add add = (a,b)->{return a+b;};
        
        or 

        Add add = (a,b)->return a+b;
    This will mean that we are using a lambda to implement a functional interface.
